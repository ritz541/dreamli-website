        <h2>Zero-Tolerance Policy</h2>
        <p>Dreamli has a strict zero-tolerance policy against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). We are

            action, and reporting to law enforcement authorities.
        </div>

        <h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
        <p>We employ the following mechanisms to ensure safety:</p>

        <h3>In-App Reporting</h3>
        <p>Users can report suspicious content or behavior directly within the app via the "Report" function found on
            every post and user profile. Reports are reviewed by our safety team within 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Content Removal</h3>
        <p>Any content identified as CSAM or CSAE will be removed immediately upon detection. We use a combination of
            automated detection tools and manual review by trained moderators.</p>

        <h3>Account Termination</h3>
        <p>Any user found to be engaging in the distribution or promotion of CSAE material will have their account
            permanently terminated. We maintain records of terminated accounts and share information with relevant
            authorities when appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Technical Safeguards</h3>
        <p>We implement the following technical measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated content filtering and detection systems</li>
            <li>Age verification mechanisms for new accounts</li>
            <li>User behavior monitoring to detect suspicious patterns</li>
            <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooperation with Law Enforcement</h2>
        <p>In accordance with US law (18 U.S.C. § 2258A) and international safety standards, we will report any
            confirmed
            instances of CSAM to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and relevant local law
            enforcement authorities. We maintain detailed records of all reports and cooperate fully with law
            enforcement
            investigations.</p>

        <h2>Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>Dreamli is intended for users 13 years of age and older. We verify age during the registration process and
